## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use TypeScript strictly typed - no `any` unless absolutely necessary
- Follow the existing code style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused

Example:
```typescript
/**
 * Creates a new policy for managing resource permissions
 * @param name - The unique identifier for this policy
 */
export class Policy<Actor, Resource> {
    constructor(name: string) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

### Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for all new features
- Maintain existing tests
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```typescript
describe('Policy', () => {
    it('should correctly evaluate a simple permission rule', () => {
        // test implementation
    });
});
```
